# nanoPage

*nanoPage* is a minimal static flat file CMS based on [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org)
[Spock](htp://spock.li). It is suitable for small websites or microsites with mostly static content.
Content is stored as [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown),
and edited offline using any Markdown editor. A *nanoPage* website is published
by compiling both source code and static content. The resulting executable is
fully self-contained with web-server *and* content. As such, it is fast, easy to
deploy and easy to secure. A demo is running on [http://nanopage.li](http://nanopage.li)

*nanoPage* is covered by the very permissive MIT license. The source code
can be found on [github](https://github.com/mayeranalytics/nanopage). 
A demo app is also on [github](https://github.com/mayeranalytics/nanopage-demo).

Documentation can be found on [http://nanopage.li/documentation](http://nanopage.li/documentation).

*nanoPage* development is currently in the *alpha* stage. Critique, suggestions, and
contributions, are most welcome.
